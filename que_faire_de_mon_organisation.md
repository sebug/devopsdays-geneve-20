# Maintenant Que mon delivery pipeline est en place, que faire de mon organisation

## Examples

### Objectives for Didier the dev
Spin up environments himself, good sample data

### Objectives for Oph√©lie from ops
Deployment is complicated, monitoring is complicated, no telling what will break in prod.

### Objectives of Pauline the product owner
Ship it.

## What if the organization is the bottleneck
Your org chart - a way to see walls. Also, a way to show intent.

Example: Accenture "Culture of cultures" - but there's only one process, so eventually everybody gets to the same thing.

You can't just transplant the model of another organization, for example [Spotify](https://blog.crisp.se/2012/11/14/henrikkniberg/scaling-agile-at-spotify)

### Example 1 - do DevOps yourself
Incorporate an ops person directly in the team.

Advantage: Closer feedback loop
Disadvantage: Still not enough buy-in, the ops person couldn't do *all* that the more standard ops people could.

### Example 2 - DevOps team
Bootstrap your product. The idea was that it would be ephemeral. And that was the problem, because the "run it" aspect was not really considered.

### Example 3 - Product team
A team that comprises all the roles necessary to design and run your product.

Problems: Scalability, again not well integrated politically.

### Example 4 - Component team Ops
Build a platform for clients.

Attention - here, reactivity is key - automate a lot!

### Example 5 - Product organization
You have a platform team and an applications team.

### Example 6 - No Ops
Try to do everything with software as a service tools.

Issue is of course that if a feature is not there in your services, then you'll have to implement anyway. Also, cost.

### Example 7 - No Ops 2
Ops is no longer a talking point - all team members have the competence to run the product.

### Example 8 - SRE
Separate Site Reliability Engineering teams, not integrated. The important thing is the processus.

Hand-back: SRE can also say that they don't want to be responsible for a flaky product.
