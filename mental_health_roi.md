# The ROI of Mental Health: Building Happier, More Profitable Companies
Vinciane de Pape

She'll be talking about the Silicon Valley / North America perspective on the
workplace.

Showing some bad job postings.

In Canada: 500k people missed work just this week due to mental health issues, that's costly.

## How do we avoid mental health issues
- Create open vacation policies, but with a minimum number of days
- Offer flexible work arrangements
- Honor the 40 hour work week (consequences: >= 11 hours a day - doubling risk of depression)
- Respect boundaries
- Reconsider open-plan office layouts (increases anxiety, especially for women)
- Educate yourself about what mental health means
- Lead by example

### What you can do yourself
- Set healthy boundaries
- Practice self-care (from taking the dog for a walk up to therapy)
- Ask for help
- Start the conversation


## What does that look like?
- Improved attitudes towards mental health
- Improved engagement
- Decreased inefficiency and errors
- ...
- Decrease in lost revenue due to missed work

## Brainstorming ideas
- Not ensuring your employees "keep busy"
- As a manager: at one point you can also ensure that people don't get overinvolved
- Ask how your colleagues are doing (question about employee engagement "I have somebody at work who cares how I'm doing")
